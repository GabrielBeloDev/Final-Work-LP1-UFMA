## About

Final project of the programming language I subject at the Federal University of Maranh√£o. In this work our group(Gabriel Bastos,Gabriel Belo and Joao Felipe) was responsible for developing an algorithm for the knapsack problem, a classic optimization problem, for this problem we used a solution with dynamic programming.

## Problem

The knapsack problem is a classic problem in combinatorial optimization. We are given a set of items, each with a weight and a value, and we need to determine the number of each item to include in a collection so that the total weight is less than or equal to a given limit and the total value is as large as possible.



## How to Run

1. Clone the project: 
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/Gabriel-Bastos-Rabelo/Final-Work-LP1.git or https://github.com/GabrielBeloDev/Final-Work-LP1.git
```
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Compile the C code.
```bash
$ gcc -o main main.c
```
4. Run the executable.
```bash
$ ./main
```

## Instance Reading Example

The program reads the instance from a file. The instance must be formatted as follows:

1. The first line contains two integers, the number of items `n` and the maximum weight `W`.
2. The next `n` lines each contain two integers, the value and weight of each item.

Example:
```
5 15
12 4
2 2
1 1
1 2
4 10
```

This instance represents a knapsack problem with 5 items and a maximum weight of 15. The items have values and weights as follows: (12, 4), (2, 2), (1, 1), (1, 2), (4, 10).

The instance file should be located in the same directory as the executable and should be named `instance.txt`.
